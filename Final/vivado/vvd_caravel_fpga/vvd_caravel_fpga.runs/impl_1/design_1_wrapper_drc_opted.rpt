Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/VexRiscv/IBusCachedPlugin_cache/ways_0_tags_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/VexRiscv/IBusCachedPlugin_cache/ways_0_tags_reg/ENARDEN (net: design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/VexRiscv/IBusCachedPlugin_cache/IBusCachedPlugin_iBusRsp_stages_1_output_m2sPipe_ready) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/mprj/user_arbiter/out_valid_1_r_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
